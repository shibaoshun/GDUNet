# AioCT: All-in-One Computed Tomography Artifact Reduction
*Baoshun Shi，Chaowei Wang, Ke Jiang, Huazhu Fu*
## Abatract
Computed Tomography (CT) under undersampled measurement conditions and presence of metallic implants will produce various artifacts, thereby compromising both image quality and clinical reliability. Existing deep learning-based artifact reduction (AR) methods are typically tailored to a single artifact type, resulting in limited generalization across diverse artifact types and poor adaptability to mixed artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose a residual prompt-based method, AioCT, for all-in-one AR that can effectively mitigate various types of artifacts. In particular, our method uses the estimation of task-specific residual between the artifact-contaminated image and the underlying image to generate the artifact-specific information, which is then used as semantic priors of artifacts and task-aware prompts to dynamically guide the AR network. To enhance the discrimination ability for various types of AR tasks and structural preservation ability of the entire network, a hybrid optimization strategy consisting of contrastive learning and task-aware optimization is proposed. Specifically, we formulate contrastive prompt regularization to enforce clear task boundaries, while use uncertainty estimation enables adaptive supervision through task-aware uncertainty modeling. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and clinical datasets demonstrate superior generalization to various artifacts scenarios even mixed artifacts, as well as improved structural fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art AR methods.
